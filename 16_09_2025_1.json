    "summary": "The proclamation designates September 11, 2025, as Patriot Day, marking 24 years since the attacks and calling the nation to remember the lives lost, the courage of first responders, and the unity that followed. It also underscores a firm national security stance, pledging that any future attack would meet a powerful response.\n\nThe document retells the events of that morning, honors the heroism on Flight 93, and pays tribute to firefighters, police, and other responders who risked everything. It directs government offices to lower flags to half\u2011staff and invites governors, communities, and individuals to join in remembrance. It encourages young people to speak with family members, neighbors, service members, and first responders to learn their stories and keep the memory alive.\n\nThis message may comfort and validate families who lost loved ones, survivors still living with injuries or illness, and first responders whose service is recognized. Communities planning memorials and educators teaching new generations gain a clear call to engage, and those who favor a strong deterrent posture may feel reassured by the emphasis on national defense.\n\nAt the same time, annual commemorations can reopen wounds for people directly affected, making the day emotionally difficult. Some readers may find the emphasis on military strength and retribution too forceful for a remembrance message, preferring a focus on healing and reflection. Others may wish the proclamation addressed the broader social impacts that followed the attacks. The document keeps its focus on honoring victims, preserving memory, and asserting national resolve."
