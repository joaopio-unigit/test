    "summary": "This set of federal rules aims to boost public safety on the water and make communications more reliable during disasters and mental health crises.\n\nFirst, the Coast Guard created a temporary moving safety zone around two vessels during a naval salvage operation in Apra Harbor, Guam. Boats must stay 100 yards away unless given permission by the local captain of the port. The zone will be enforced only when salvage work is underway, and mariners will be alerted through official notices. The goal is to protect crews and nearby boaters while work happens quickly and safely, with minimal paperwork and no significant environmental impact. Those who benefit include salvage teams, Navy and Coast Guard personnel, and anyone transiting the harbor who gains from reduced risk. Those who may be inconvenienced are local mariners, charter operators, and harbor businesses that could face brief access limits or detours while the zone is active.\n\nSecond, the Federal Communications Commission clarified when companies can pause certain network outage filings during declared disaster reporting periods. If a report is due before the first disaster filing deadline, it still must be submitted. After that first deadline, filings in the disaster system can take the place of the usual outage reports as long as they are timely. The agency declined to let companies withdraw reports already filed just because a disaster was declared, and it kept in place the requirement to notify 911 centers and the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline quickly about outages. This gives providers clearer rules and less duplicate work during emergencies, while preserving the timely information that emergency centers need to keep the public safe. Providers, especially smaller ones, may still feel some administrative burden because certain notifications remain mandatory.\n\nThird, the Commission adopted a new requirement to route 988 text messages to local crisis centers based on the texter\u2019s general location rather than their phone number\u2019s area code. Carriers must supply coarse, aggregated location data\u2014not precise coordinates\u2014to the Lifeline\u2019s platform so people can reach nearby help. Nationwide wireless companies have 18 months to comply; all other covered text providers have 36 months. People in crisis and local communities stand to benefit from faster connections to nearby resources. Carriers will need to invest in new systems and coordination, and privacy advocates will watch closely to ensure location data is limited and protected as promised."
