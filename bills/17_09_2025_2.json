    "summary": "The latest Federal Register brings a mix of safety updates, trade policy steps, event logistics, and environmental compliance changes.\n\nAviation regulators extended the time airlines have to address certain overhead oxygen mask panel issues on Boeing 787s. The fix is still required, but operators now have up to three years to complete it, and older panels that meet updated labeling standards can be used. Commerce set up a new, structured way for U.S. automakers and parts manufacturers to ask the government to add more auto parts to the list of items facing national security tariffs, with quarterly filing windows and a 60\u2011day decision timeline. The Coast Guard announced temporary waterway controls on the Savannah River during the Ironman triathlon on September 28 to keep participants and boaters safe. And the Environmental Protection Agency extended some deadlines tied to restrictions on trichloroethylene, a solvent, including more time for facilities that use it in nuclear fuel production and tighter timing for stopping disposal of the chemical into wastewater; public comments on that change are open until October 17.\n\nWho benefits? Airlines and suppliers get more time to plan and carry out the 787 oxygen panel work without disrupting operations, while the safety intent remains. U.S. automakers and parts makers gain a clear path to request tariff coverage on additional parts they believe affect national security, potentially leveling the field against rising imports. Local communities and event organizers benefit from clear Coast Guard rules that help the Ironman go off safely. Companies that rely on trichloroethylene\u2014especially in highly specialized processes\u2014get added time to transition and update labels and safety documents, reducing the risk of supply shocks.\n\nWho could be negatively affected? Extending the 787 compliance window may concern those who prefer faster safety fixes, even as regulators judge the timing acceptable. Importers and manufacturers that depend on global auto parts could face added costs or uncertainty if more parts are brought under tariffs, which could ripple to consumers. Boaters and river businesses may face short\u2011term access limits during the triathlon. Health and environmental advocates may worry that pushing back some trichloroethylene deadlines slows risk reduction. For those who want a say, Commerce is taking comments on the auto parts process through early November, and EPA\u2019s comment window runs to mid\u2011October."
