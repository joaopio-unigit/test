    "summary": "The FDA has finalized a simple but important change: it\u2019s reverting its regulations to remove language that explicitly treated lab-developed tests as medical devices, after a federal court threw out the 2024 rule that added that language. The update takes effect immediately and is meant to align the Code of Federal Regulations with the court\u2019s decision.\n\nWho benefits? Clinical laboratories, hospital labs, and companies that build tests in-house are likely to see the biggest relief. They avoid the added paperwork, reviews, and ongoing compliance work that the 2024 rule would have required. The FDA estimates this reversal avoids roughly $1.4 to $1.5 billion in annual costs, with some savings passed through from foreign suppliers. Smaller labs and startups may particularly welcome fewer regulatory hurdles and lower upfront costs.\n\nWho might be negatively affected? Patients, clinicians, and competitors who favored tighter oversight may worry about uneven test quality and transparency. The FDA\u2019s own analysis notes that stepping back from the 2024 approach means forgoing expected benefits\u2014valued at roughly $3.7 to $4.6 billion per year\u2014tied to potential improvements in safety, effectiveness, and reliability. The agency also acknowledges uncertainty in both the costs and benefits, including unknown effects on innovation. Companies that invested early to meet the 2024 requirements could feel they\u2019ve sunk resources into changes that are no longer needed.\n\nPractically speaking, this is a procedural fix, not a new policy. The FDA says no one needs time to adjust because the court had already vacated the rule; this action simply removes the now-invalid text. The definition of in vitro diagnostic products returns to how it read before May 2024.\n\nA couple of smaller updates traveled alongside this one: the FDA corrected an error in an animal drug listing rule from August, and the Federal Highway Administration is rescinding a 2004 regulation related to Fish and Wildlife Service road management. There\u2019s also a brief note that the derivatives regulator extended a compliance date on a separate reporting form."
