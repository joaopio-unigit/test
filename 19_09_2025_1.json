    "summary": "The big headline here is that the Food and Drug Administration is formally rolling back its 2024 change that treated lab-developed tests as medical devices. A federal court set that rule aside in March, and this action simply restores the older wording to match the court\u2019s decision.\n\nWho benefits? Clinical laboratories and test developers avoid a large set of new reviews and paperwork that would have come with the 2024 rule. Hospitals and health systems that run their own tests may see lower operating costs and fewer delays in bringing new tests to patients. The agency\u2019s own numbers point to about $1.4 billion in annual cost savings, with some of that tied to lower costs passed through from overseas suppliers. Regulators also describe this as a deregulatory move under White House policy, which may streamline future rulemaking.\n\nWho might be negatively affected? Patients and clinicians could see less uniform oversight of test quality across the country. The agency had estimated sizeable public health benefits from tighter review, including more consistent accuracy and reliability for tests used to guide care. Those expected benefits\u2014valued by the agency at several billion dollars a year\u2014are now forgone. Some labs and companies that already invested to comply with the 2024 rule may have sunk costs they cannot recover. The back-and-forth also adds uncertainty for innovators and investors trying to plan long-term product strategies.\n\nTwo smaller items appear in the same notice. The Food and Drug Administration corrected an error in a recent update to animal drug listings, a housekeeping fix to a table entry. And the Federal Highway Administration is rescinding older regulations about management systems for roads that serve national wildlife refuges, another cleanup step with limited day-to-day impact. There is also a brief voting summary noting an extension of a hedge fund reporting date at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nTaken together, the main effect is a shift back to the pre-2024 approach for lab-developed tests, with cost relief for labs and a renewed debate over how best to ensure test quality and patient safety."
